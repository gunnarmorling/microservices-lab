== Change Data Capture with Kafka Connect and Debezium

This part of the lab introduces you to change data capture (CDC) using http://debezium.io/[Debezium].
Debezium allows you to capture data changes from MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB, Oracle and SQL Server and stream those events into Apache Kafka.
It is based on https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect[Kafka Connect].
Streaming data changes from your database enables many interesting use cases such as

* Replicating data across databases by different vendors
* Synchronizing data between microservices
* Updating fulltext search indexes (e.g. Elasticsearch) or caches (e.g. https://www.redhat.com/de/technologies/jboss-middleware/data-grid[JBoss Data Grid])
* Running stream queries such as sliding averages of the value of incoming orders etc.

In this module of the lab you'll learn the following things:

* Setting up Kafka Connect with the Debezium CDC connector for MySQL
* Configuring an instance of that connector, ingesting changes from an existing example CRUD application
* Different ways of processing change data events
** Streaming data changes to a Postgres sink database
** Programmatically consuming change events using Thorntail and CDI and streaming them to a web browser via WebSockets

The overall architecture of this lab module looks like this:

=== Setting Up the Example Application

We've prepared a small https://github.com/debezium/microservices-lab/tree/master/eventr[CRUD microservice for managing orders of events], which we'll use in the following as source of data change events.
It is based on https://thorntail.io/[Thorntail], an approach for building microservices using Java EE and MicroProfile, and uses MySQL as its database.

Start a MySQL instance by running:

[source, sh]
$ oc new-app --name=mysql debezium/example-mysql:0.8
$ oc set env dc/mysql MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=debezium MYSQL_USER=mysqluser MYSQL_PASSWORD=mysqlpw

Then build and start the application.
This uses the https://github.com/fabric8/s2i-java[Fabric8 S2I] ("source to image") builder image which will fetch the application's source code from the given location, build it using Maven and then run the Thorntail uber JAR:

[source,sh]
----
$ oc new-app --name=eventrapp fabric8/s2i-java:latest~https://github.com/debezium/microservices-lab \
    --context-dir=eventr \
    -e AB_PROMETHEUS_OFF=true \
    -e JAVA_OPTIONS=-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
----

We still need to expose port 8080 for the application and set up a route for it
(as that's not done automatically by the S2I builder image).
To do so, use `oc patch` and expose a route for the service like so:

[source,sh]
----
$ oc patch service eventrapp -p '{ "spec" : { "ports" : [{ "name" : "8080-tcp", "port" : 8080, "protocol" : "TCP", "targetPort" : 8080 }] } } }'

$ oc expose svc eventrapp
----

Verify that the pods of the database and the application are running:

[source,sh]
----
$ oc get pods
----

The S2I build will take some time, as it has to fetch all the required Maven dependencies and plug-ins.
Once the build has completed, you should see the following status
(the build job must be "Completed", the actual application and the database "Running"):

[source,sh]
NAME                                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
eventrapp-1-build                             0/1       Completed   0          2m
eventrapp-1-m4rss                             1/1       Running     0          39s
mysql-2-gk8nw                                 1/1       Running     0          2m
...

To improve execution time for subsequent builds (e.g. after code changes to the application),
you can make the build an https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.9/html/developer_guide/builds#source-to-image-strategy-options[incremental S2I build], in which case the previously fetched dependencies would be re-used):

[source,sh]
----
$ oc patch bc/eventrapp -p '{"spec":{"strategy":{"sourceStrategy":{"incremental":true}}}}'
buildconfig "eventrapp" patched
----

The hostname of the exposed eventrapp service is available in the OpenShift console, or can be retrieved via CLI:

[source]
$ oc get routes eventrapp -o=jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}'

Note the output, which should be in the format eventrapp-voxxed.<YOUR SERVER IP>.nip.io and you can navigate there using a browser.
Alternatively, you could click on the application's URL within the OpenShift web UI.

You can use "Populate Data" to create some example data (Click on "Search orders" after that to see the created entries).
Otherwise just insert a few records as you like.

=== Setting Up Kafka Connect With the Debezium Connectors

Now it's time to deploy Kafka Connect and Debezium.
Kafka Connect is a platform for streaming data between Apache Kafka and other systems.
It provides a framework and runtime environment for _source connectors_ (for getting data into Kafka)
and _sink connectors_ (for getting data out of Kafka).
Debezium provides a set of CDC source connectors for databases such as MySQL, Postgres and MongoDB.

Let's begin by setting up a Kafka Connect cluster,
using the S2I process provided by Strimzi.
This makes it very easy to create a Kafka Connect cluster with additional connectors such as the ones provided by Debezium:

[source]
----
$ oc process strimzi-connect-s2i \
    -p CLUSTER_NAME=debezium \
    -p KAFKA_CONNECT_CONFIG_STORAGE_REPLICATION_FACTOR=1 \
    -p KAFKA_CONNECT_OFFSET_STORAGE_REPLICATION_FACTOR=1 \
    -p KAFKA_CONNECT_STATUS_STORAGE_REPLICATION_FACTOR=1 \
    | oc apply -f -
----

Use `oc status` to verify that the S2I process has finished
(a deployment of `svc/debezium-connect` should be in state deployed):

[source]
----
$ oc status
----

Alternatively, you can check in the OpenShift web UI that the rolling deployment for "debezium-connect" has finished.

Then download the following files:

* the Debezium CDC connector for MySQL
* the Confluent JDBC sink connector and the Postgres database driver
* the Confluent Elasticsearch sink connector and its dependencies

Extract the downloaded files and trigger another S2I build of `debezium-connect`, this time including these additional resources:

[source,sh]
----

cd .. && \
oc start-build debezium-connect --from-dir=. --follow && \
cd ..
----

You should see an output like this:

[source]
----
Uploading directory "." as binary input for the build ...

Pushed 7/9 layers, 78% complete
Pushed 8/9 layers, 89% complete
Pushed 9/9 layers, 100% complete

----

Use `oc get pods` again to verify that Kafka Connect is running:

[source,sh]
----
$ oc get pods

NAME                                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
debezium-connect-3-mpscv                      1/1       Running     0          1m
...
----

Once that's the case, register an instance of the Debezium MySQL connector using the REST API of Kafka Connect:

[source]
----
$ oc exec -c kafka -i my-cluster-kafka-0 -- curl -s -X POST \
    -H "Accept:application/json" \
    -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
    http://debezium-connect-api:8083/connectors -d @- <<'EOF'

{
    "name": "inventory-connector",
    "config": {
        "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector",
        "tasks.max": "1",
        "database.hostname": "mysql",
        "database.port": "3306",
        "database.user": "debezium",
        "database.password": "dbz",
        "database.server.id": "184054",
        "database.server.name": "dbserver1",
        "database.whitelist": "inventory",
        "database.history.kafka.bootstrap.servers": "my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092",
        "database.history.kafka.topic": "schema-changes.inventory",
        "transforms": "route",
        "transforms.route.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.RegexRouter",
        "transforms.route.regex": "([^.]+)\\.([^.]+)\\.([^.]+)",
        "transforms.route.replacement": "$3"
    }
}
EOF
----

This sets up an instance of Debezium's `io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector` class,
using the given credentials.
By specifying the `database.whitelist` option (or, on a more fine-grained level, `table.whitelist`), we can narrow down the set of captured tables.

Kafka Connect’s log file should contain messages regarding execution of initial snapshot (look for log messages like "INFO Step 1 ..."):

[source,sh]
----
$ oc logs $(oc get pods -o name -l strimzi.io/name=debezium-connect)
----

You can examine CDC messages in Kafka using the console consumer (use Ctrl + C to exit the tool):

[source]
----
$ oc exec -c kafka -it my-cluster-kafka-0 -- /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh \
   --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 \
   --from-beginning \
   --property print.key=true \
   --topic EventrOrder
----

Note that by default topic names follow the pattern "<db server name>.<db name>.<table name>".
By means of the `RegexRouter` in the connector configuration we've changed that so that the topic name is just the unqualified table name.
You should see messages comprising of a key and a value like the following (formatted for the sake readability),
representing the `Order` records as per the initial snapshot.

Message key and value use JSON (the binary Avro format could be used alternatively),
and both contain a payload as well as a schema describing the structure of the payload.

The key's payload resembles the primary key of the represented record.
The value's payload contains information of

* the old state of the changed row (`before`, which is null in the case of an insert or record created during snapshotting)
* the new state of the changed row (`after`)
* metadata such as the table and database name, a timestamp etc.

If you now use the web app to insert, update or delete records while keeping the console consumer running, you'll see how corresponding CDC messages arrive in the topic.

Using the Kafka Connect REST API, you also can query the list of connectors, query the status of a given connector, delete a connector and more:

[source]
----
# List all connectors
$ oc exec -c kafka -i my-cluster-kafka-0 -- curl -w "\n" -s -X GET \
    -H "Accept:application/json" \
    -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
    http://debezium-connect-api:8083/connectors
----

[source]
----
# Get status of "inventory-connector"
$ oc exec -c kafka -i my-cluster-kafka-0 -- curl -w "\n" -s -X GET \
    -H "Accept:application/json" \
    -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
    http://debezium-connect-api:8083/connectors/inventory-connector/status
----

[source]
----
# Delete "inventory-connector" (don't run it, as we'll still need the connector in the following)
$ oc exec -c kafka -i my-cluster-kafka-0 -- curl -w "\n" -s -X DELETE \
    -H "Accept:application/json" \
    -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
    http://debezium-connect-api:8083/connectors/inventory-connector

=== Processing Change Data Events

Examining change events in the Kafka console is a good first step,
but eventually we'd like to consume the events in a more meaningful way.

In the following different ways for consuming events are explored.
You can choose the one you are most interested in or walk through all the alternatives,
as your preference.

==== Streaming Data Changes to a Postgres Sink Database

To stream data changes into another database, no manual programming effort is needed.
Instead, the Confluent JDBC sink connector for Kafka Connect can be used to data into a target database.

So let's set up another database (Postgres in this case) and stream the data changes there.

[source]
----
$ oc new-app \
    -e POSTGRESQL_USER=postgresuser \
    -e POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=postgrespw \
    -e POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=inventory \
    centos/postgresql-95-centos7
----

Once the database has started (use `oc get pods` to verify that Postgres is running), register an instance of the Confluent JDBC sink connector:

[source]
----
$ oc exec -c kafka -i my-cluster-kafka-0 -- curl -s -X POST \
    -H "Accept:application/json" \
    -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
    http://debezium-connect-api:8083/connectors -d @- <<'EOF'
{
    "name": "jdbc-sink",
    "config": {
        "connector.class": "io.confluent.connect.jdbc.JdbcSinkConnector",
        "tasks.max": "1",
        "topics": "EventrOrder",
        "connection.url": "jdbc:postgresql://postgresql-95-centos7:5432/inventory?user=postgresuser&password=postgrespw",
        "transforms": "unwrap",
        "transforms.unwrap.type": "io.debezium.transforms.UnwrapFromEnvelope",
        "auto.create": "true",
        "insert.mode": "upsert",
        "pk.fields": "id",
        "pk.mode": "record_value"
    }
}
EOF
----

This sets up an an instance of `io.confluent.connect.jdbc.JdbcSinkConnector`,
listening to the `EventrOrder` topic and streaming all data changes to the given database connection.
As this sink connector just expects the effective state of changed rows
(i.e. the "after" part from the Debezium data change messages),
only this part is extracted using Debezium's `UnwrapFromEnvelope` SMT (single message transform).

With the sink connector being set up, we can take a look into the Postgres database and see how the table changes are propgated there.
Get a shell on the pod of the Postgres service:

[source,sh]
----
$ oc rsh $(oc get pods -o name -l app=postgresql-95-centos7)
----

Run a query to get all records from the table corresponding to the monitored topic:

[source,sh]
----
psql -U postgresuser inventory -c 'select * from "EventrOrder"'
----

As you alter records in the source web application,
you'll see how the table in Postgres gets updated accordingly, if you re-execute the query.
Note that `DELETE` operations currently cannot be propagated, as they are not yet supported by the Confluent JDBC sink connector.

To leave the shell on the Postgres pod, run:

[source]
----
exit
----

==== Streaming Change Events To Elasticsearch

The beauty of using Apache Kafka for streaming change events is its flexibility.
As the topics are persistent, additional consumers can come up which have not been known when data changes originally occurred.

As an example, lets stream the `EvntrOrder` events to Elasticsearch now, too, making them available to the powerful fulltext search capabilities.

TODO: must be run upfront on the host, should go into general set-up

[source]
----
$ sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
----

Set up a single Elasticsearch node
(it'd be a complete customer in production, but a single node is fine for the purposes of this lab)
and expose it as a service:

[source]
----
$ oc new-app -e ES_JAVA_OPTS="-Xms512m -Xmx512m" elasticsearch:6.4.2
$ oc expose svc/elasticsearch
----

Create a configuration file for Elasticsearch:

[source]
----
$ cat > elasticsearch.yml << EOF
cluster.name: docker-cluster123
network.host: 0.0.0.0
discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 1
discovery.type: single-node
EOF
----

And make its contents available as a config map:

[source]
----
$ oc create configmap es-config --from-file=elasticsearch.yml
----

Finally, the config map contents can be exposed to the Elasticsearch container using a volume:

[source]
----
$ oc set volumes dc/elasticsearch --overwrite --add \
  -t configmap \
  -m /usr/share/elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml \
  --sub-path=elasticsearch.yml \
  --name=es-config \
  --configmap-name=es-config
----

This triggers a restart of the Elasticsearch node; once it's up again (use `oc get pods` to verify),
it's time to register an instance of the Elasticsearch sink connector:

[source]
----
$ oc exec -c kafka -i my-cluster-kafka-0 -- curl -X POST -s -w "\n" \
    -H "Accept:application/json" \
    -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
    http://debezium-connect-api:8083/connectors -d @- <<'EOF'
{
    "name": "elastic-sink",
    "config": {
        "connector.class": "io.confluent.connect.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchSinkConnector",
        "tasks.max": "1",
        "topics": "EventrOrder",
        "connection.url": "http://elasticsearch:9200",
        "key.ignore": "false",
        "type.name": "order",
        "behavior.on.null.values" : "delete",
        "topic.index.map" : "EventrOrder:eventrorder",
        "transforms": "unwrap,key",
        "transforms.unwrap.type": "io.debezium.transforms.UnwrapFromEnvelope",
        "transforms.key.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.ExtractField$Key",
        "transforms.key.field": "id"
    }
}
EOF
----

This listens to the `EventrOrder` topic and pushes corresponding index updates to Elasticsearch.
As index names must be lower-cased, the topic is named to the "eventrorder" index name.
The `UnwrapFromEnvelope` transformation is used to extract only the "after" state from Debezium's change events.
Using the `ExtractField` transformation we make sure that the original record id is used as the document id in Elasticsearch.

If the connector is deployed, you can query the index via its REST API.

Get its URL by executing:

[source]
$ oc get routes elasticsearch -o=jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}'

Open that URL in a browser, it should be in the form http://elasticsearch-voxxed.<YOUR SERVER IP>.nip.io/.

To browse the contents of the `eventrorder` index, go to http://elasticsearch-voxxed.<YOUR SERVER IP>.nip.io/eventrorder/_search?pretty.
Alternatively, you can use curl to do so:

[source]
$ oc exec -i my-cluster-kafka-0 -- curl -s -X GET "elasticsearch:9200/eventrorder/_search?pretty"

==== Streaming Aggregate Events To Elasticsearch

By default Debezium creates one Kafka topic per table captured in the source database.
It often is a requirement though to have events that contain a complete aggregate from the domain model,
e.g. an order and all its order lines.

There are different approaches for creating such aggregate events:

* Use a streaming query engine such as KStreams to join the topics of the involved tables
* Materialize aggregates in a separate table within the source database

In the following we're going to follow the second option.
For that, a small extension to Hibernate ORM has been provided as part of the example application.
By means of putting the `@MaterializeAggregate` to an aggregate root of the domain model,
this entity and all its dependent types will be serialized as a JSON structure into the `aggregates` within the source database.
We then can use Debezium to capture the changes of that table.
A Kafka Connect SMT (single message transformation) is used to route the change events retrieved from that aggregate table into one topic per aggregate type.

Let's begin by starting another build of Kafka Connect containing this SMT:

[source,sh]
----
cd plugins/debezium-connector-mysql && \
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/debezium/microservices-lab/master/json-expansion-smt/json-expansion-smt-1.0.0.Final.jar && \
cd .. && \
oc start-build debezium-connect --from-dir=. --follow && \
cd ..
----

Once the build has completed and Kafka Connect is running again,
register another instance of the Debezium MySQL connector:

[source,sh]
----
$ oc exec -c kafka -i my-cluster-kafka-0 -- curl -s -X POST -w "\n" \
    -H "Accept:application/json" \
    -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
    http://debezium-connect-api:8083/connectors -d @- <<'EOF'

{
    "name": "aggregates-connector",
    "config": {
        "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector",
        "tasks.max": "1",
        "database.hostname": "mysql",
        "database.port": "3306",
        "database.user": "debezium",
        "database.password": "dbz",
        "database.server.id": "184055",
        "database.server.name": "dbserver1_aggregates",
        "database.whitelist": "inventory",
        "table.whitelist": "inventory\\.aggregates",
        "database.history.kafka.bootstrap.servers": "my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092",
        "database.history.kafka.topic": "schema-changes.inventory_aggregates",
        "transforms" : "expandjson",
        "transforms.expandjson.type": "io.debezium.aggregation.smt.ExpandJsonSmt"
    }
}
EOF
----

This captures only changes to the `aggregates` table and applies the `ExpandJsonSmt` SMT for routing the events to the correct topic.
After the connector has been deployed, create a few records in the example application and observe the corresponding aggregate events in the Kafka topic:

[source,sh]
----
oc exec -c kafka -it my-cluster-kafka-0 -- /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh \
   --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 \
   --from-beginning \
   --property print.key=true \
   --topic orders_with_event
----

Let's deploy another instance of the Elasticsearch sink connector for streaming the aggregate events into Elasticsearch:

[source,sh]
----
$ oc exec -c kafka -i my-cluster-kafka-0 -- curl -X POST -w "\n" \
    -H "Accept:application/json" \
    -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
    http://debezium-connect-api:8083/connectors -d @- <<'EOF'
{
    "name": "orders-with-event-sink",
    "config": {
        "connector.class": "io.confluent.connect.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchSinkConnector",
        "tasks.max": "1",
        "topics": "orders_with_event",
        "connection.url": "http://elasticsearch:9200",
        "key.ignore": "false",
        "type.name": "orders_with_event",
        "behavior.on.null.values" : "delete",
        "transforms": "unwrap,key",
        "transforms.unwrap.type": "io.debezium.transforms.UnwrapFromEnvelope",
        "transforms.key.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.ExtractField$Key",
        "transforms.key.field": "id"
    }
}
EOF
----

To browse the contents of the `orders_with_event` index, go to http://elasticsearch-voxxed.<YOUR SERVER IP>.nip.io/orders_with_event/_search?pretty.
Alternatively, you can use curl to do so:

[source]
$ oc exec -i my-cluster-kafka-0 -- curl -s -X GET "elasticsearch:9200/orders_with_event/_search?pretty"

Having the complete aggregate within a single index allows for efficient queries based on all the properties of the aggregate,
no matter in which table they are stored within the source database.

==== Consuming Data Change Events With Thorntail

oc new-app --name=order-reporting fabric8/s2i-java:latest~https://github.com/gunnarmorling/microservices-lab.git#kstreams \
    --context-dir=order-reporting \
    -e AB_PROMETHEUS_OFF=true \
    -e KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 \
    -e JAVA_OPTIONS=-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true

oc patch bc/order-reporting -p '{"spec":{"strategy":{"sourceStrategy":{"incremental":true}}}}'

oc patch service order-reporting -p '{ "spec" : { "ports" : [{ "name" : "8080-tcp", "port" : 8080, "protocol" : "TCP", "targetPort" : 8080 }] } } }'

oc expose svc order-reporting

oc get routes order-reporting -o=jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}'



----
TODO: We could replace this part and show how to throw KStreams into the mix and run some streaming queries on the CDC data.
Essentially, this would be taken from the Kafka Summit demo:

    https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples/tree/master/kstreams-live-update

We'd only adjust it to the domain model of our example here of course.
----

Finally, let's explore how to consume the Debezium events in a custom application and forward them to a web UI using WebSockets.

The example application for that is based on https://thorntail.io/[Thorntail],
which provides an alternative approach for packaging and running Java EE applications.
Instead of deploying to an application server, Thorntail creates a self-contained executable JAR
which contains your application and just those parts of the Java EE platform which it requires.

The application sources are provided at the lab's https://github.com/debezium/microservices-lab/tree/master/debezium-thorntail-demo[GitHub repo].
Again we're using an S2I process for building and deploying the application:

[source,sh]
----
$ oc new-app --name=websocketsinkapp fabric8/s2i-java:latest~https://github.com/debezium/microservices-lab.git \
    --context-dir=debezium-thorntail-demo \
    -e MYSQL_DATABASE=inventory \
    -e AB_PROMETHEUS_OFF=true \
    -e KAFKA_SERVICE_HOST=my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap \
    -e KAFKA_SERVICE_PORT=9092 \
    -e JAVA_OPTIONS=-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true

# Make subsequent builds of the application executing faster
$ oc patch bc/websocketsinkapp -p '{"spec":{"strategy":{"sourceStrategy":{"incremental":true}}}}'
----

In this case we're using the https://hub.docker.com/r/fabric8/s2i-java/[Java S2I image] provided by the fabric8 project.
(Note there's commercial support available for running Thorntail applications on OpenShift in form of the https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhoar/overview/[RHOAR product]).

We still need to expose port 8080 for the application and set up a route for it
(as that's not done automatically by the S2I builder image).
To do so, use `oc patch` and expose a route for the service like so:

[source]
----
$ oc patch service websocketsinkapp -p '{ "spec" : { "ports" : [{ "name" : "8080-tcp", "port" : 8080, "protocol" : "TCP", "targetPort" : 8080 }] } } }'

$ oc expose svc websocketsinkapp
----

To consume the Debezium CDC events from the Kafka topic,
the application uses https://github.com/aerogear/kafka-cdi[kafka-cdi], a CDI portable extension provided by the AeroGear project.
This happens in the https://github.com/debezium/microservices-lab/blob/master/debezium-thorntail-demo/src/main/java/com/example/dbzdemo/ws/WebSocketChangeEventHandler.java[WebSocketChangeEventHandler] class.
All it then needs to do is to push all incoming events via WebSockets to all connected clients.
For that purpose, the https://github.com/debezium/microservices-lab/blob/master/debezium-thorntail-demo/src/main/java/com/example/dbzdemo/ws/ChangeEventsWebsocketEndpoint.java[ChangeEventsWebsocketEndpoint] class registers all clients with the event handler upon connection creation.

Wait until the S2I build has finished and the application is running
(again this initial build will take a few minutes for downloading all required dependencies, while future incremental ones will be faster).

[source,sh]
----
$ oc get pods

NAME                                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
websocketsinkapp-1-build                      0/1       Completed   0          5m
websocketsinkapp-1-hkxgb                      1/1       Running     0          3m
...
----

Once the application is running, get its URL by executing:

[source]
$ oc get routes websocketsinkapp -o=jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}'

Open that URL in a browser, it should be in the form http://websocketsinkapp-voxxed.<YOUR SERVER IP>.nip.io/.

Modify some entries in the CRUD application and observe how the change events are propagated to the other browser window via WebSockets in near-realtime.

==== Environment cleanup

After you complete all modules in this exercise then you can clean up the environment by issuing commands

[source,sh]
$ oc cluster down
$ mount | grep -o '/home/build/openshift.local.clusterup/[^ ]*' | xargs sudo umount && sudo rm -rf $HOME/openshift.local.clusterup

=== Summary

In this part of the lab you've learned about the concept of change data capture and how to implement it using Debezium and Kafka (Connect).
You've set up the Debezium connector for MySQL to ingest changes of an existing Java EE application,
without requiring any code changes to that application.
Then you've explored different ways for consuming the change events:
using Kafka Connect and the JDBC sink adaptor to simply stream the data into a Postgres database
and using Thorntail and CDI to consume change events programmatically and relay them to a web browser using WebSockets.

To learn more about Debezium, refer to its homepage http://debezium.io[http://debezium.io],
where you can find an extensive tutorial, documentation and more.
